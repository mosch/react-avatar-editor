## Accessing the resulting image

The resulting image will have the same resolution as the original image, regardless of the editor's size.
If you want the image sized in the dimensions of the canvas you can use `getImageScaledToCanvas`.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import AvatarEditor from 'react-avatar-editor'

class MyEditor extends React.Component {
  onClickSave = () => {
    if (this.editor) {
      // This returns a HTMLCanvasElement, it can be made into a data URL or a blob,
      // drawn on another canvas, or added to the DOM.
      const canvas = this.editor.getImage()

      // If you want the image resized to the canvas size (also a HTMLCanvasElement)
      const canvasScaled = this.editor.getImageScaledToCanvas()
    }
  }

  setEditorRef = (editor) => (this.editor = editor)

  render() {
    return (
      <AvatarEditor
        ref={this.setEditorRef}
        image="http://example.com/initialimage.jpg"
        width={250}
        height={250}
        border={50}
        scale={1.2}
      />
    )
  }
}

export default MyEditor
```

## Adding drag and drop

We recommend using [react-dropzone](https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone). It allows you to add
drag and drop support to anything really easy. Here is an example how to use it with react-avatar-editor:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import AvatarEditor from 'react-avatar-editor'
import Dropzone from 'react-dropzone'

class MyEditor extends React.Component {
  state = {
    image: 'http://example.com/initialimage.jpg',
  }

  handleDrop = (dropped) => {
    this.setState({ image: dropped[0] })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Dropzone
        onDrop={this.handleDrop}
        noClick
        noKeyboard
        style={{ width: '250px', height: '250px' }}
      >
        {({ getRootProps, getInputProps }) => (
          <div {...getRootProps()}>
            <AvatarEditor width={250} height={250} image={this.state.image} />
            <input {...getInputProps()} />
          </div>
        )}
      </Dropzone>
    )
  }
}
```

## Accessing the cropping rectangle

Sometimes you will need to get the cropping rectangle (the coordinates of the area of the image to keep),
for example in case you intend to perform the actual cropping server-side.

`getCroppingRect()` returns an object with four properties: `x`, `y`, `width` and `height`;
all relative to the image size (that is, comprised between 0 and 1). It is a method of AvatarEditor elements,
like `getImage()`.

_Note that:_ `getImage()` returns a canvas element and if you want to use it in `src` attribute of `img`, convert it into a blob url.

```js
const canvas = this.editor.getImage().toDataURL();
let imageURL;
fetch(canvas)
  .then(res => res.blob())
  .then(blob => (imageURL = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob)));

// Usage
<img src={imageURL} ... />
```
